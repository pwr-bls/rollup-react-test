- Create a Tag Field component for a UI Kit.

- The component has an input field and a button with `Add tag` text. If you type something into the input field and press the `Add tag` button, the current text has to be stored as a tag and the app has to store the tags in Redux store. All the stored tags have to be rendered under the input field, next to each other. If you click on a tag, the app has to delete it from the Redux store.

- The component has to be reuseable.

- The reusable component has to be in the `src/components` folder.

- The redux files have to be stored in the `src/redux` folder.

- All states have to be managed in Redux.

- For the styling, you can use `CSS` or `SASS`, but inline styling is not accepted.

- All styling information is available in Figma.
